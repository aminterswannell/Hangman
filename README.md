# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. 
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Installation Instructions:


## Usage Instructions:
In order to play the game, you must guess a single alphabetical character when prompted, guessing anything other than a single alphabetical character will cause the program to ask you to re-try and enter again. 
You have 5 lives, each incorrect guess loses you a life, run out of lives and you lose the game.
You must guess until you have gotten the entire word correctly, which will be clear as the list of '_' corresponding to the letters in the word will now just read the word in single characters, and the number of unique letters left to guess will show as 0.
